This folder consists of the summary files of my final project for my translational bioinformatics course
The project consisted of taking a publically available dataset, aligning it, and performing differential analysis

I have included the jupiter notebook file showing the process of downloading the files, quality control, and performing star analysis.
This setup is much cleaner looking than my salmon input files but I included those because they were in python and still useful.

The r file "DE_project2" is a modified version of the standard that I use.  It looks at the normalization of the analysis and performs the differential expression.
Additionally, the file will produce commonly used plots including PCA, volcano, histogram of pvalues, heatmap, and a MA plot.
