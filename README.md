# BioinformaticScripts
Two of python and R scripts used for bioinformatic analysis.

The RNA seq with Star is the project I sumbmitted a last month for my class where I performed aligned in Star on a public available dataset.
It includes the jupyter notebook walking through the bash steps of the alignment and then includes the DESeq2 R Analysis for reviewing.

The RNA seq with Salmon is how projects were done when I first started.  It has an example of annotation using biomaRt, using python to connect
fastq files and run them all through bash through python.  Then it includes the script used to combine all the counts from the quant.sf files that salmon outputs into one text file.
